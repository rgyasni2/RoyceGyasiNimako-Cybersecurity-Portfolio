AWS Security Baseline + Risk Register Project

Overview:
For this project I will be setting up a AWS Envioronemnt that includes a overprivileged IAM user, an insecure EC2 instance, and a empty S3 bucket. I will then be making a risk register to identify any risk that I found before starting the remediation process. I then will remediate all findings to create a safe environment.
