I decided to make a proper risk register as before I had a rough idea of what I was supposed to do but now i can put my findings into a clean documentation. 

| ID   | Findings                                    | Assets               | Risks                                            | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Recommendations                                       | Status |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| F-01 | SSH open to internet (`0.0.0.0/0`)          | EC2 / Security Group | Increases attack surface and brute-force risk    | High       | Medium | High     | Restrict SSH to trusted IP or remove SSH and use SSM  | Closed |
| F-02 | No SSM role attached to EC2                 | EC2 / IAM Role       | Requires reliance on SSH/key-based access        | Medium     | Medium | Medium   | Attach EC2 role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`   | Closed |
| F-03 | IAM user has AdministratorAccess            | IAM User             | High blast radius if account is compromised      | High       | High   | Critical | Replace with least-privilege policy and MFA           | CLosed |
| F-04 | CloudTrail not enabled                      | AWS Account          | Reduced audit visibility and forensic capability | Medium     | High   | High     | Enable multi-region CloudTrail with management events | Closed |
