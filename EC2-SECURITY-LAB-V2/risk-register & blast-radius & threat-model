This file includes a risk register having a clear understanding of what the risks that come with this instance, a threat model to dive deeper into how the threats can be exploited, and finally a blast radius to have an acccurate scope of privilege. 

Risk Register:
| ID   | Findings                                    | Assets               | Risks                                            | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Recommendations                                       | Status                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| F-01 | SSH open to internet (`0.0.0.0/0`)          | EC2 / Security Group | Increases attack surface and brute-force risk    | High       | Medium | High     | Restrict SSH to trusted IP or remove SSH and use SSM  | Remediated                 |
| F-02 | No SSM role attached to EC2                 | EC2 / IAM Role       | Requires reliance on SSH/key-based access        | Medium     | Medium | Medium   | Attach EC2 role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`   | Remediated                 |
| F-03 | IAM user has AdministratorAccess            | IAM User             | High blast radius if account is compromised      | High       | High   | Critical | Replace with least-privilege policy and MFA           | Accepted (Lab Constraint)  |
| F-04 | CloudTrail not enabled                      | AWS Account          | Reduced audit visibility and forensic capability | Medium     | High   | High     | Enable multi-region CloudTrail with management events | Remediated                 |

Threat Model

Initial Access: Exposed SSH or weak exposure controls

Privilege Risk: Overprivileged IAM user compromise

Visibility Gap: No CloudTrail limits investigations

Storage Risk: Accidental public S3 exposure

Blast Radius Analysis

If IAM user is compromised: Full administrative control of the AWS account due to AdministratorAccess.

If EC2 instance is compromised: Impact is limited by the attached EC2 role permissions (SSM access), but misconfigurations could still increase exposure if security controls are changed.

This makes it interview-ready with almost no extra work.
