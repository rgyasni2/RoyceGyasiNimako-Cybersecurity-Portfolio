This file includes a risk register having a clear understanding of what the risks that come with this instance, a threat model to dive deeper into how the threats can be exploited, and finally a blast radius to have an acccurate scope of privilege. 

Risk Register:
| ID   | Findings                                    | Assets               | Risks                                            | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Recommendations                                       | Status     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| F-01 | SSH open to internet (`0.0.0.0/0`)          | EC2 / Security Group | Increases attack surface and brute-force risk    | High       | Medium | High     | Restrict SSH to trusted IP or remove SSH and use SSM  | Remediated |
| F-02 | No SSM role attached to EC2                 | EC2 / IAM Role       | Requires reliance on SSH/key-based access        | Medium     | Medium | Medium   | Attach EC2 role with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`   | Remediated |
| F-03 | IAM user has AdministratorAccess            | IAM User             | High blast radius if account is compromised      | High       | High   | Critical | Replace with least-privilege policy and MFA           | Remediated |
| F-04 | CloudTrail not enabled                      | AWS Account          | Reduced audit visibility and forensic capability | Medium     | High   | High     | Enable multi-region CloudTrail with management events | Remediated |

Threat Model: 
Initial access: exposed SSH / weak exposure controls
Privilege risk: overprivileged IAM user compromise
Visibility gap: no CloudTrail limits investigations
Storage risk: accidental public S3 exposure

Blast Radius:
Since the IAM user has AdministratorAccess then they have access to any tools that they would like. 
For the EC2 instance they can change the security controls to be as accessible as possible.
