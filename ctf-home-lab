Overview: 
CTF Path & Lab Builder is an interactive web app designed to help cybersecurity beginners find the right CTF challenges for their skill level. The app analyzes the user's experience, interests, and tech setup, then recommends specific CTF platforms, a custom learning roadmap, and safe home lab setup instructions.

This was my first cybersecurity project and my introduction to building tools using PartyRock.
